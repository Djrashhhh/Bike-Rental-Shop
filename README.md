# Bike-Rental-Shop
Using postgreSQL, I created an interactive bash program that stores information for a bike rental shop.
The main menu prompts the user to choose between 3 options: Rent a bike, return a bike or exit the main menu.
For option 1: You are given a list of all available bikes to choose from. Then you enter your name and phone number which is saved in the bikes psql database. A user can rent several bikes. For a user that is saved in the database they will not be required to write their name. They will just enter their phone number and rent the bike they choose.
For option 2: You are asked to enter your phone number to verify if indeed you are in the bike shop's database, then a list of all the bikes is displayed and you are asked which one you want to return.
The user can exit the program at any time after renting or returning a bike.
